This week, we will discuss automating the deployment of our Tech Blog more.

Initially, we created the S3 bucket and CloudFront resources manually.

Now, let's incorporate the steps into a CI/CD pipeline. 

The concepts and tools covered in this blog are,

- VCS              - Git & GitHub
- IaC              - Terraform
- CI/CD            - GitHub Actions
- Cloud Provider   - AWS

Are you keen to learn the process? Here we go with our [Assignment - Week#02](https://www.skool.com/cloudtalents/demo-week01?p=5da1ea21). Try do it yourself.
